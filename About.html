“India has seen a dream of digital India. From latest science to latest technology, everything should be available at the tip of one’s finger.” 

 

-Narendra Modi 

(Hon’ble Prime Minister) 

 

Origin Of The Idea 

India is a land of farmers. Nearly 70% of the Indian population is engaged in farming activities – the primary sector. Even the secondary and tertiary sectors depend on them. Indian farmers work all day and night to sell their products at a better rate. The one main defect of the Indian Agricultural marketing is the presence of too many middlemen and exploitation of farmers by them. On one hand these middlemen exploit the farmers by purchasing the produce at lower prices and on the other hand they exploit the customers by demanding higher prices from them. The only aim of a number of commission agents, brokers etc. is to derive a higher income from the middle processes. These middlemen take undue advantage of the poor former on the basis of their financial resources. 

 

About the Website 

This portal has been designed to tackle the above issue and meet the objective of providing a better environment for selling and buying of agricultural produce. Its salient features include: 

1.Real time information on trade and price. 

2. Extended access to market across various regions.                

3. Increase in farmer's profit by bridging the gap between buyers        and farmers.    

4. Information on quality of commodities. 

5. Transfer of payment credits directly to the farmer. 

 

Mechanism and Features 

 

To promote uniformity in agriculture marketing by streamlining of procedures across the integrated markets, removing information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and promoting real time price discovery based on actual demand and supply. This is achieved by:  

Farmers and bidders will register themselves on the portal with an e-mail, thus, making the process hassle-free. 

The functioning has been kept very smooth and easy. Keeping in mind the cognitive understanding of the farmers. 

The portal has been designed to be bilingual, I.e., it is available in both languages – English and Hindi. 

The portal is highly graphical and has been kept aesthetically appealing. 

 Farmers will post their products for sale along with necessary details so that the bidder gets a thorough idea of the agricultural product. 

Bidder can contact the farmer by “Message” option provided in the Product Details section. 

Online Payment option has also been included to save the time and hustle involved in the traditional marketing system. 

Those, who cannot pay online, can also contact the farmer for direct payment. 

There is a ‘Popular Entries’ section on the main page so that the buyers can get an idea of all the newly uploaded products. 

10.Buyer’s Guide is also included in the portal, clearly mentioning the rules and regulations governing the marketing. 

 

Promoting the dream of Digital India 

 

This way of a “Smart Interaction” between the farmers and the bidders, we believe, will contribute significantly towards our hon’ble Prime Minister’s dream of a Digital India. 

Integration of APMCs across the country through a common online market platform to facilitate pan-India trade in agriculture commodities, providing better price discovery through transparent auction process based on quality of produce along with timely online assistance.
